# [Aimlab Stats Tracker](aimlab-tracker.vercel.app)

This is a simple website I created to track Profiles on [Aimlab](https://aimlab.gg)

In addition to tracking Profiles the website also provides stat tracking for [Voltaic](https://voltaic.gg) and [Revosect](https://revosect.com) Benchmarks

## How to use:

## Player Profile

Navigate to the Profile Page and insert a player's username (_case sensitive_)

-   You can use **thenoobsaibot** as an example.

From here you can navigate to the [Voltaic](https://voltaic.gg) and [Revosect](https://revosect.com) Benchmarks Pages
